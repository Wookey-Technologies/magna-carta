# 1 The Eight Ates

The culture we project is the culture we invite. As developers, creators and community members of an open social platform, it is our collective duty to consciously cultivate a positive, fair and mutually beneficial culture. These 8 principles encapsulate the ethos of Sansar. They are not rules or laws, but rather the values that we apply when making rules, when working on or in the platform and when interacting with others in the community.

# 1.1 Accommodate

Inclusivity and accessibility are core principles at Sansar. Everyone is welcomed and respected, except those who refuse to welcome and respect others. We conduct ourselves in good faith and we assume the same of others. 

# 1.2 Appreciate
We practice gratitude, because our success is made possible by good fortune and the efforts of others as much as by our own efforts. We are generous with praise and we give credit where it's due.

# 1.3 Stimulate
Sansar exists to offer people meaningful and impactful experiences; to encourage and reward curiosity. Wherever possible, we aim to amaze and inspire.

# 1.4 Educate
A rising tide lifts all boats. Always be teaching, always be learning. Improve your own skills and those of others around you; stay open-minded.

# 1.5 Collaborate
The things we do collectively are more meaningful than the things we do alone. When people work together, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts—especially if they’re different from each other.

# 1.6 Innovate
We already know what happens when you do things the same way they’ve always been done, so let’s try new ways of doing things.

# 1.7 Iterate
Digital creations are living things that can and should be continually improved and optimized.

# 1.8 Mitigate
It’s not enough to do no harm, we must actively work to counteract it. The real world is rife with exploitation and systemic bias. Not only do those things have no place in Sansar, but as Sansarians we do what we can to make a positive impact on the real world.

# 2 Application

This is the default Sansar conduct policy. It is user-genertated policy and not policy set by Sansar as a company.

## 2,1 Terms Of Service

No policy can contain anything that violates the Sansar Terms Of Service (TOS). If it does, the TOS will always superceede it.

## 2.2 Adherance to local laws

No policy can contain anything that violates real-world laws. All individuals must always obey laws within their legal jurisdictions.

## 2.3 Scope

This policy applies to all people that visit Sansar worlds, including Sansar employees.
