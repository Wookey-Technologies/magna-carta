# Welcome to the Sansar Magna Carta contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing! :blue_heart::blue_heart::blue_heart:

This guide will give you an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue to creating a PR ([Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)), reviewing, and finally to merging of the PR.

The content and format of this document was taken in whole or in part from GitHubs own [documentation contribution guidelines](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

You can use the table of contents icon in the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).  Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

> **Note**  
> You do not need to know how to make a PR to contribute. Opening a [Discussion](https://github.com/Wookey-Technologies/magna-carta/discussions) or an [Issue](https://github.com/Wookey-Technologies/magna-carta/issues) will allow the community to help decide on the best action and someone else will create the PR for you.

## Getting started

For more information on how we write markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/content-markup-reference.md).

### Issues & Discussions

#### Create a new issue or Discussion

If you spot a problem in the Magna Carta documents, you should first search if an [issue](https://github.com/Wookey-Technologies/magna-carta/issues) or relevant [discussion](https://github.com/3MUl0R/magna-carta/discussions) already exists.  
Here's info on [how to search issues & PR on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).  
If a related issue or discussion doesn't exist, you can open a new one of the appropriate type.
- issues are good for raising concerns about problems you may have with existing content: [new issue form](https://github.com/Wookey-Technologies/magna-carta/issues/new/choose)
- discussions are great for proposals that may result in community conversation and are highly recommended: [new discussion form](https://github.com/3MUl0R/magna-carta/discussions/new)

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/Wookey-Technologies/magna-carta/issues) to find one that interests you. 
As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to be resolved by anyone specifically. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Making Changes

> **Note**  
> In case you missed it, you do not need to know how to make a PR to contribute. Opening a Discussion or an Issue will allow the community to help decide on the best action and someone else can do the heavy lifting of creating the PR.

#### Make changes in the web UI

Click the pencil icon near the upper right corner of a document to fork the repository and begin making changes. You can then [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review.  This is probably the easiest method for someone new to the Git process.

#### Make changes locally on your system

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

- Using VSCode:
  - [Download VSCode Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - [Learn about working with GitHub in VSCode Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github)

2. [Create a working branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) and start making changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.  Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process:

#### Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations! Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible in the repository.
